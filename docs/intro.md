# Search
I currently support search using Sourcegraph, only OSS needed.

Many approaches possible
* Using m²
  Scripted changes with output and exit code capture
* Use IntelliJ Search&Replace
* Any way you invent yourself
  the clones are on your filesystem

# Distribute change
Commit, Push, Fork, Pull request using m²

Received feedback on PRs?  
Clone them and improve.  
Reword titles and body.
